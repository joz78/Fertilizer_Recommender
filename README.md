## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring Model Performance in Production

To ensure my fertilizer recommendation model remains accurate and reliable in production, Iâ€™ll implement a structured monitoring strategy:

1. **Establish Baseline Metrics**  
   Before deployment, Iâ€™ll define key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. These benchmarks will help me detect any performance degradation over time.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   Iâ€™ll track model drift (changes in prediction patterns), data drift (shifts in input distributions), and prediction quality. Automated alerts will notify me of significant changes so I can respond quickly.

3. **Automated Retraining Pipelines**  
   Iâ€™ll set up retraining workflows that trigger when performance drops below a threshold. This ensures the model adapts to new data and remains effective.

4. **A/B Testing and Canary Deployments**  
   When updating the model, Iâ€™ll use A/B testing or canary deployments to compare versions safely and minimize risk before full rollout.

5. **Root Cause Analysis**  
   If degradation occurs, Iâ€™ll investigate data quality issues, concept drift, and feature relevance. This helps me decide whether to clean data, adjust features, or retrain the model.

6. **Monitoring Tools**  
   I plan to use tools like Evidently AI, AWS SageMaker Model Monitor, or Azure ML Monitoring to streamline drift detection and maintain reliability.

By following this approach, Iâ€™ll proactively monitor my model, respond to issues quickly, and ensure it continues to deliver value in real-world agricultural settings.
